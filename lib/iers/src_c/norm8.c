/*  This function normalizes a given three dimensional vector A. */

/*  In general, Class 1, 2, and 3 models represent physical effects that */

/*  Status: Canonical model */

/*     Class 1 models are those recommended to be used a priori in the */
/*     reduction of raw space geodetic data in order to determine */
/*     geodetic parameter estimates. */
/*     Class 2 models are those that eliminate an observational */
/*     singularity and are purely conventional in nature. */
/*     Class 3 models are those that are not required as either Class */
/*     1 or 2. */
/*     Canonical models are accepted as is and cannot be classified as a */
/*     Class 1, 2, or 3 model. */
