           RTKLIB: An Open Source Program Package for GNSS Positioning

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW

RTKLIB is an open source program package for standard and precise positioning
with GNSS (global navigation satellite system). RTKLIB consists of a portable
program library and several APs (application programs) utilizing the library.
The features of RTKLIB are:

(1) It supports standard and precise positioning algorithms with:
    
    GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, BeiDou and SBAS
    
(2) It supports various positioning modes with GNSS for both real-time- and
    post-processing:
    
    Single, DGPS/DGNSS, Kinematic, Static, Moving-Baseline, Fixed,
    PPP-Kinematic, PPP-Static and PPP-Fixed.
    
(3) It supports many standard formats and protocols for GNSS:
    
    RINEX 2.10,2.11,2.12 OBS/NAV/GNAV/HNAV/LNAV/QNAV, RINEX 3.00,3.01,3.02
    OBS/NAV,RINEX 3.02 CLK,RTCM ver.2.3,RTCM ver.3.1 (with amendment 1-5),
    RTCM ver.3.2, BINEX, NTRIP 1.0, NMEA 0183, SP3-c, ANTEX 1.4, IONEX 1.0,
    NGS PCV and EMS 2.0.
    
(4) It supports several GNSS receivers' proprietary messages:
    
    NovAtel: OEM4/V/6,OEM3,OEMStar,Superstar II, Hemisphere: Eclipse,Crescent,
    u-blox: LEA-4T/5T/6T, SkyTraq: S1315F, JAVAD GRIL/GREIS, Furuno
    GW-10-II/III and NVS NV08C BINR.
    
(5) It supports external communication via:
    
    Serial, TCP/IP, NTRIP, local log file (record and playback) and FTP/HTTP
    (automatic download).
    
(6) It provides many library functions and APIs (application program
    interfaces):
    
    Satellite and navigation system functions, matrix and vector functions,
    time and string functions, coordinates transformation, input and output
    functions, debug trace functions, platform dependent functions,
    positioning models, atmosphere models, antenna models, earth tides models,
    geoid models, datum transformation, RINEX functions, ephemeris and clock
    functions, precise ephemeris and clock functions, receiver raw data
    functions, RTCM functions, solution functions, Google Earth KML converter,
    SBAS functions, options functions, stream data input and output functions,
    integer ambiguity resolution, standard positioning, precise positioning,
    post-processing positioning, stream server functions, RTK server
    functions, downloader functions.
    
(7) It includes the following GUI (graphical user interface) and CUI
    (command-line user interface) APs.

    (h) NTRIP Browser                NTRIPSRCBROWS   -
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

(8) All of the executable binary APs for Windows are included in the package as
    well as whole source programs of the library and the APs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM REQUIEREMENTS

The executable binary GUI and CUI APs included in the package require Microsoft
Windows environment. On the other OS or environment, you have to compile and
build CUI APs by yourself.
All of the library functions and APIs were written in ANSI C (C89). The library
internally uses winsock and WIN32 thread for Windows with the compiler option
-DWIN32 and the standard socket and pthread (POSIX thread) for Linux/UNIX
without any option. By setting the compiler option -DLAPACK or -DMKL, the
library uses LAPACK/BLAS [36] or Intel MKL for fast matrix computation. The CUI
APs were written in ANSI C. The library and CUI APs can be built on many
environments like gcc on Linux. The GUI APs were written in C++ and utilize
Embarcadero/Borland VCL (visual component library) for GUI toolkits. All of the
executable binary APs in the package were built by Embarcadero C++ builder XE2
Starter Edition on Windows 7.
The executable GUI APs were tested on Windows 7 (64bit). The CUI APs were also
built and tested on Ubuntu 11.04 Linux and x86 CPU.

Notes:
Previous versions of RTKLIB until ver. 2.4.1 were built by a free edition of
Borland C++ (Turbo C++ 2006). Turbo C++, however, is no longer supported in
ver. 2.4.2 because of type incompatibility problem of GUI strings between
ver.2.4.2 and the previous ones.
